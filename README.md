# Picture Perfect Photography Website

(Created from beginning of November 2023 to end of December 2023)

This is a third and final project I created in my HTML course, where I designed a website about a picture perfect photography club. The website includes six different pages to view from the home page till the gallaery page. This project had more fuctions added such as adding social media buttons, choosing a file image from your desktop, sending a message, voting on certain pictures, etc. Enjoy viewing the pictures throughout the site.

To view the website easily and quickly without having to download files, here is a link I created to click below to an easy access in viewing my site through raw.githack.com.
